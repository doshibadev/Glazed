Glazed - built artifact for Meteor Client 1.21.1

Files:
- glazed-1.21.1-n-01.jar — remapped jar for Meteor Client 1.21.1 (place into Meteor Client's mods folder or Fabric's mods folder used by Meteor)

How to install:
1. Close Minecraft.
2. Copy `glazed-1.21.1-n-01.jar` into your Meteor Client mods directory (typically `%appdata%/.meteor-client/mods` or your Fabric mods folder used by Meteor).
3. Start Minecraft 1.21.1 with Fabric + Meteor Client (meteor version: 0.5.8-SNAPSHOT). Verify the mod loads in the mods list.

Notes:
- Build was performed with Java 21 and Yarn mappings for 1.21.1.
- There were two mixin mapping warnings during compilation (possible signature differences). If you encounter mixin errors at runtime, report the log and I will update mixin targets.
